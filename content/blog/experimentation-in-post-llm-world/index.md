From my innovation research we are pretty well versed with the fact that experimentation is a crucial part of innovation processes. This is in part due to the inherently unknown outcomes of innovation, which can lead to unexpected results and require continuous learning and adaptation. Similiarly, involving multiple stakeholders in the processes has been a popular approach to ensure the innovation process also incorporates the goals and views of all stakeholders, elading to better societal outcomes and generally leading to more responsible innovation. I have a section in my PhD on responsible innovation which you can read here: Lindfors ([2025](#ref-lindforsEvolutionTechnologicalTrajectories2025)).

I've always been a curious person, and I am blown away by the new possibilities that arise from the post-LLM world. One of the largest hurdles traditionally assiciated with at least digital innovation has been barriers to entry in the form of knowledge gap. LLM's can help solve this. I have a great example on this.

# Ocean Modeling
At my previous job, we were seeing that we needed to include better ocean modelling along the norwegian coast to be able to predict currents, temperature and salinity. There was great work already conducted by IMR together with MET with the norkyst model (more on the technical details in my blog post [Ocean Modeling](/blog/ocean-modeling)). (Coming soon, be sure to subscribe!).

I also contacted MET and they were very helpful and discussed what their issues were and what were the bottlenecks in their current approach. Certainly they have excellent people and interesting projects going on, but I still thought i could contribute by trying out to do things a bit differently by just trying something new and see if it would work. 

# Embedded Systems and microcontrollers
My partner had an issue at work where they needed to automatically measure biomass of kelp gametophytes cultures. It was quite easy to find out what would be viable experimentation paths forward here due to her domain expertise and my previous experience with microcontrollers at home, slmon farming and fascination with the programming lanuage rust. So we sat down and thought about what would be possible ways to solve this issue, and consulted claude and chatgpt to brainstorm ideas. 

I knew that costs for spectophotometry was coming down significantly and claude suggested that there were also ready made modules that could easily and cheaply be used to measure spectral data. Thus it was clear that we could set up a little experiment at home to test the feasibility of this approach. More on that in my blog post [spectral measurement](/blog/spectral-measurement). (Also coming soon).

# Sea lice modelling 
Connected to the issue of currents and ocean modelling i also started to look into how salomn lice spread and their lifecycles.
